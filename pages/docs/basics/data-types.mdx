**JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values.**

There are two types of data types in JavaScript.

1. Primitive data type
2. Non-primitive (reference) data type

<Callout
    type={"info"}
    emoji={"ðŸš©"}>
    JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type
    of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You
    need to use `let` here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of
    values such as numbers, strings etc. For example:
</Callout>

```js
let a = 40; //holding number type data
let b = "Ripon"; //holding string type data
```

### Primitive data type

Primitive means a simple value.it can be anything. there are 5 types of primitive data types.

| Data Type | Description                                    |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| String    | represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello" |
| Number    | represents numeric values e.g. 100             |
| Boolean   | represents boolean value either false or true  |
| Undefined | represents undefined value                     |
| Null      | represents null i.e. no value at all           |

### String

Any Text value is represented as a string type. like "hello world" Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes:

Example:

```js
// Using double quotes:
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";

// Using single quotes:
let carName2 = "Volvo XC60";
```

### Number

All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point). Numbers can be written with, or without decimals:

Example:

```js
// With decimals:
let x1 = 34.0;

// Without decimals:
let x2 = 34;
```

### Boolean

Booleans can only have two values: `true` or `false`. Booleans are often used in conditional testing. Example:

```js
let x = 5;
let y = 5;
let z = 6;
(x == y)(
    // Returns true
    x == z
); // Returns false
```

### Undefined

In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined. Any variable can be emptied, by setting the value to undefined. The type will also be undefined.

Example:

```js
let car; // Value is undefined, type is undefined
```

### Null

null means that the value is null, value is defined but its null. null value can be changed. Example:

```js
let cash = null; // Value is null, type is object
```

### JavaScript non-primitive data types

The non-primitive data types are as follows:

| Data Type | Description                                             |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Object    | represents instance through which we can access members |
| Array     | represents group of similar values                      |
| RegExp    | represents regular expression                           |

### Object

JavaScript objects are written with curly braces {}.

Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.

Example:

```js
const person = {
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    age: 50,
    eyeColor: "blue",
};
```

The object (person) in the example above has 4 properties: firstName, lastName, age, and eyeColor.

### Array

JavaScript Arrays JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.

Array items are separated by commas.

The following code declares (creates) an array called `cars`, containing three items (car names): Example

```js
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
```

### RegExp(Reguler Expression)

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations.

**we will know abour RegExp later**
