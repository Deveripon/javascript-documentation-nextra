**JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values.**

There are two types of data types in JavaScript.

1. Primitive data type
2. Non-primitive (reference) data type

<Callout
    type={"info"}
    emoji={"ðŸš©"}>
    JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type
    of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You
    need to use `let` here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of
    values such as numbers, strings etc. For example:
</Callout>

```js
let a = 40; //holding number type data
let b = "Ripon"; //holding string type data
```
