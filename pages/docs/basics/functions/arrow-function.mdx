Arrow functions allows a short syntax for writing function expressions.

You don't need the function keyword, the return keyword, and the curly brackets.

Example:

```javascript
// Arrow Function Syntax
const myArrowFunction = () => {
    console.log("Hello, I'm From Arrow Function");
};

myArrowFunction(); // Output : Hello, I'm From Arrow Function
```

Shorthand:

If function have a single parameter then you can use this shorthand

```js
const myShortArrowFunc = (name) => {
    console.log("hello world");
};
myShortArrowFunc(); // Output : "hello world"
```

If function have a single line statement then you can use this shorthand

```js
const myShortArrowFunc = () => 10 + 20;
myShortArrowFunc(); // Output : 30
```

Arrow functions do not have their own `this`. They are not well suited for defining object methods.

Arrow functions are not `hoisted`. They must be defined before they are used.

Using `const` is safer than using `var`, because a function expression is always constant value.

You can only omit the return keyword and the curly brackets if the function is a single statement. Because of this, it might be a good habit to always keep them:
