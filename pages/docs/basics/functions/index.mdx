**A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.**

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

Example:

```js filename="function.js" showLineNumbers copy
//this is a function declaration. and it will be executed when it invokes
function doSum(val1, val2) {
    return val1 + val2;
}
```

## JavaScript Function Syntax

A JavaScript function is defined with the `function` keyword, followed by a `name`, followed by `parentheses ()`,followed by `curly brackets{}`.

Function names can contain `letters`, `digits`, `underscores`, and `dollar` signs (same rules as variables).

The `parentheses()` may include `parameter` names separated by commas: e.g:(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside `curly brackets: {}`

```js showLineNumbers copy
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

Function `parameters` are listed inside the `parentheses ()` in the function definition.

Function `arguments` are the values received by the function when it is invoked.

Inside the function, the `arguments` (the parameters) behave as local variables.

## Why Functions?

With functions you can reuse code.

You can write code that can be used many times.

You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.

## Function Defination

JavaScript functions are defined with the `function` keyword.

You can use a `function declaration` or a `function expression`. Earlier in this tutorial, you learned that functions are declared with the following syntax:

```js
function functionName(parameters) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are `invoked` (called upon).

## Function Parameters and Arguments

Earlier in this tutorial, you learned that functions can have parameters:

```js
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

Function parameters are the names listed in the function definition.

Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function.

### Parameter Rules

-   JavaScript function definitions do not specify data types for parameters.

-   JavaScript functions do not perform type checking on the passed arguments.

-   JavaScript functions do not check the number of arguments received.

### Default Parameters

If a function is called with missing arguments, the missing values are set to undefined.

Sometimes this is acceptable, but sometimes it is better to assign a default value to the parameter.

Example:

```js
//If y is not passed or undefined, then y = 10.

function myFunction(x, y = 10) {
    return x + y;
}
myFunction(5);
```

### Function Rest Parameter

Sometimes you will not know that how much parameters will pass in invocation times. In that case you cant receive parameters in a normal way. In this situation you can use `...rest` parameters to receive all the parameters as an array.

Example:

```js showLineNumbers copy
function doSum(...rest) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let item of rest) sum += item;
    return sum;
}
doSum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13);

//Output : 91 ;
```

in above example the `doSum() `function will perform `sum` of given numbers. but no one knows that how much number will come as arguments. so this is not possible to define `parameter`. so in this situation you can use `...rest` parameter to receive all the arguments.

### The Arguments Object

JavaScript functions have a `built-in object` called the `arguments` object.

The `argument` object contains an array of the arguments used when the function was called (invoked).

This way you can simply use a `function` to find (for instance) the highest value in a list of numbers:

```js
x = sumAll(1, 123, 500, 115, 44, 88);

function sumAll() {
    let sum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
        sum += arguments[i];
    }
    return sum;
}
```

 Arguments are Passed by `Value`

The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments.

JavaScript arguments are passed by `value`: The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations.

If a function changes an argument's value, it does not change the parameter's original value.

**Changes to `arguments` are not visible (reflected) outside the function.**

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
Objects are Passed by `Reference`

In JavaScript, object references are values.

Because of this, objects will behave like they are passed by reference:

If a function changes an object property, it changes the original value.

**Changes to object properties are visible (reflected) outside the function.**

</Callout>

## Function Invocation

The code inside a function is not executed when the function is defined.

The code inside a function is executed when the function is invoked.

It is common to use the term "call a function" instead of "invoke a function".

It is also common to say "call upon a function", "start a function", or "execute a function".

```js showLineNumbers {1-5,8}
//== function defination start ==//
function myFunction(a, b) {
    return a * b;
}
//== function defination end ==//

//== function Invocation ==//
myFunction(10, 2); // Will return 20
```

in above example `line number 1 to 5 is function defination`,and it will not execute the written code inside the function untill the function is invoked.

`in line number 8, the function is invoked`. and the function will executed here.
