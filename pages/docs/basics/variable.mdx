**Variables are Containers for Storing Data.**

JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

-   Automatically
-   Using `var`
-   Using `let`
-   Using `const`

## Automatically

in JavaScript variables can be set automatically without using any keyword. example:

```javascript filename="index.js" showLineNumbers
x = 5;
y = 5;
z = x + y;
```

abobe example `x , y ,z` are variables,which are automatically declared without using any keyword.

When to Use `var`, `let`, or `const`?
1. Always declare variables before using them.

2. Always use `const` if the value should not be changed

3. Always use `const` if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use `let` where you can't use const.

5. Only use `var` if you MUST support old browsers.

</Callout>

## var

The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

in this example `x,y,z` is variables which are set with `var` keyword.

```javascript filename="index.js" showLineNumbers
var x = 5;
var y = 5;
var z = x + y;
```

## let

in this example `x,y,z` is variables which are set with `let` keyword.

```javascript filename="index.js" showLineNumbers
let x = 5;
let y = 5;
let z = x + y;
```

The `let` keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

Variables declared with `let` have Block Scope

Variables declared with `let` must be Declared before use

Variables declared with `let` cannot be Redeclared in the same scope

</Callout>

### Cannot be Redeclare

Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.

You can not accidentally redeclare a variable declared with let.

With let you can not do this:

```javascript filename="index.js" showLineNumbers
let x = "hello akash";
let x = "hello tapash";
//Syntax error : "x" has already been declared
```

### Scope

<Callout type='info' emoji={'ðŸš©'}>
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.

JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.

ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: `let` and `const`.

These two keywords (`let` , `const`) provided Block Scope in JavaScript:

</Callout>

#### Function Scope

In javascript, a function has its own local scope. which is called function scope.

example:

```js
function foo() {
    // this is the local scope of this function
    let x = 5;
}
```

inside a function declaration within `{ }` braces have its local scope. in function scoped variable cannot access outside of that function

#### Block Scope

```js
{
    // this is block scope
    let foo = "bar";
}
```

in javascript `{}` two curly brackets are known as a block. inside block declared any variable is blocked scoped variable. these variables can be access in that block.but can't access outside the block the block.

#### Global Scope

Variables declared with the `var` always have Global Scope. Variables declared with the `var` keyword can NOT have block scope.

## const

in this example `domain` is variables which are set with `const` keyword. const are constant which is not changable.

```javascript filename="index.js" showLineNumbers
//constants are set with `const` keyword
const domain = "example.com";
```

JavaScript const variables must be assigned a value when they are declared:

```javascript filename="index.js" showLineNumbers
const PI = 3.14159265359; // correct
const PI; // Incorrect
PI = 3.14159265359;

```

### When to use JavaScript const?

Always declare a variable with const when you know that the value should not be changed.

Use const when you declare:

A new `Array`

A new `Object`

A new `Function`

A new `RegExp`

The `const` keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

Variables defined with `const` cannot be Redeclared

Variables defined with `const` cannot be Reassigned

Variables defined with `const` have Block Scope

</Callout>

## JavaScript Identifiers
 All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. Names must begin with a letter. Names can also begin with $ and \_ (but we will not use it in this tutorial). Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables). Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

## Difference Between var, let and const

| keyword | Scope | Redeclare | Reassign | Hoisted | Binds this |
| ------- | ----- | --------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| var     | No    | Yes       | Yes      | Yes     | Yes        |
| let     | Yes   | No        | Yes      | No      | No         |
| const   | Yes   | No        | No       | No      | No         |
