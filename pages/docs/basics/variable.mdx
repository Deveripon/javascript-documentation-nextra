**Variables are Containers for Storing Data.**

JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:

-   Automatically
-   Using `var`
-   Using `let`
-   Using `const`

## Automatically

in JavaScript variables can be set automatically without using any keyword. example:

```javascript filename="index.js" showLineNumbers
x = 5;
y = 5;
z = x + y;
```

abobe example `x , y ,z` are variables,which are automatically declared without using any keyword.

When to Use `var`, `let`, or `const`?
1. Always declare variables before using them.

2. Always use `const` if the value should not be changed

3. Always use `const` if the type should not be changed (Arrays and Objects)

4. Only use `let` where you can't use const.

5. Only use `var` if you MUST support old browsers.

## var

The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

in this example `x,y,z` is variables which are set with `var` keyword.

```javascript filename="index.js" showLineNumbers
var x = 5;
var y = 5;
var z = x + y;
```

## let

in this example `x,y,z` is variables which are set with `let` keyword.

```javascript filename="index.js" showLineNumbers
let x = 5;
let y = 5;
let z = x + y;
```

The `let` keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)

Variables declared with `let` have Block Scope

Variables declared with `let` must be Declared before use

Variables declared with `let` cannot be Redeclared in the same scope

</Callout>

### Cannot be Redeclare

Variables defined with let can not be redeclared.

You can not accidentally redeclare a variable declared with let.

With let you can not do this:

```javascript filename="index.js" showLineNumbers
let x = "hello akash";
let x = "hello tapash";
//Syntax error : "x" has already been declared
```

## const

## JavaScript Identifiers
 All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. Names must begin with a letter. Names can also begin with $ and \_ (but we will not use it in this tutorial). Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables). Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
