Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

## Conditional Statements

Very often when you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions.

You can use conditional statements in your code to do this.

In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

<Callout
    type={"info"}
    emoji={"ðŸš©"}>
    Use `if` to specify a block of code to be executed,

    if a specified condition is true,

    Use `else` to specify a block of code to be executed,

    if the same condition is false Use `else if` to specify a new condition to test,if the first condition is false

     Use `switch` to specify many alternative blocks of
    code to be executed

</Callout>
**The switch statement is described in the next chapter.**

### The if Statement

Use the `if` statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.

Syntax:

```js
if (condition) {
    //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

<Callout
    type={"warning"}
    emoji={"ðŸ’¡"}>
    Note that `if` is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will
    generate a JavaScript error.
</Callout>

Example: Say "Good Morning" if the hour is less than 8

```js showLineNumbers
if (hour < 8) {
    return "Good Morning";
}
```

This code block will return "Good Morning"

### The else Statement

Use the `else` statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.

Syntax :

```js showLineNumbers
if (condition) {
    //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
    //  block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

Examples:

Say "Good Morning" if the hour is less than 8 otherwise say" Good Noon"

```js showLineNumbers
if (hour < 8) {
    return "Good Morning";
} else {
    return "Good Noon";
}
```

This code block will return "Good Morning"

### The else if Statement

Use the else if statement to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.

Syntax:

```js showLineNumbers
if (condition1) {
    // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
    // block of code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
    // block of code to be executed if both condition is false
}
```

Examples:

-   If the waiting time is less then 1 hour than say "okay no problem"

-   else if the waiting time is grater than 1 hour say "Feeling Bored"

-   else say "Feeling angry"

```js showLineNumbers
if (time < 1) {
    return "Okay no problem";
} else if (time > 1) {
    return "Feeling Bored";
} else {
    return "Feeling angry";
}
```
