The `map() `method in JavaScript is used to create a new `array` by applying a function to each element of an existing `array`. Itâ€™s particularly useful when you need to transform the elements of an array without modifying the original `array`.

## Syntax of map():

```js showLineNumbers
let newArray = array.map((element, index, array) => {
    // Code to execute on each element
    return newValue; // New transformed value to store in the new array
});
```

-   `element`: The current element being processed in the `array`.
-   `index` (optional): The index of the current element being processed.
-   `array` (optional): The `array` `map()` was called upon.
-   `Returns`: A new `array` with the transformed values.

Example: Basic Usage of `map()`

```js showLineNumbers
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const doubled = numbers.map(function (number) {
    return number * 2;
});

console.log(doubled); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] (original array remains unchanged)
```

In this example:

-   The `map()` method loops through the `numbers` `array`.
-   Each number is multiplied by `2`, and the result is stored in the new `array` `doubled`.
-   The original `numbers` `array` remains unmodified.

How `map()` Works:

-   `Original Array`: The original array remains intact.
-   `Transformation`: Each element is transformed by the provided callback function.
-   `New Array`: A new array with the transformed values is returned.
