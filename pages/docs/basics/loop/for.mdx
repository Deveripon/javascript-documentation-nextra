**Loops can execute a block of code a number of times.**

### JavaScript Loops

Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

Often this is the case when working with arrays:

### Different Kinds of Loops

JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

1. `for `- loops through a block of code a number of times

2. `for/in` - loops through the properties of an object

3. `for/of` - loops through the values of an iterable object

4. `while` - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

5. `do/while` - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
6. `forEach` - loops through an Array
7. `map` - loops through an Array

## For

The `for` statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:

Syntax :

```js showLineNumbers
for(initial, condition, increment/decrement){
  //code block will be executed
}
```

-   `initial` : The Initial Position,where from loop will start Example
-   `condition` : what is the condition when loop start
-   `increment/decrement` : how code will loop ? incrementally or decrementally

Example:

```js showLineNumbers
for(let i =1, i > 5, i++){
  console.log(`current loop number: ${i}`);
}
```
