The `while` loop in JavaScript is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given `Boolean` condition. The loop continues to execute as long as the condition evaluates to `true`. Once the condition evaluates to false, the loop stops.

## Syntax of the while Loop:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers /condition/
while (condition) {
    // code to be executed
}
```

-   `condition`: This is a Boolean expression (`true` or `false`). The loop keeps executing as long as this condition is `true`.
-   The code inside the loop executes repeatedly until the condition becomes `false`.

Example: Basic `while` Loop

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
let count = 0;

while (count < 5) {
    console.log(count);
    count++;
}
```

Output:

```json
0
1
2
3
4
```

In this example:

-   The loop runs as long as `count` is less than `5`.
-   After each iteration, the value of `count` is increased by `1` (`count++`).
-   The loop stops when `count` becomes `5` because the condition (`count < 5`) becomes `false`.
