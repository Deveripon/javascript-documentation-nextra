The `forEach()` loop in JavaScript is a built-in array method that allows you to execute a provided function once for each element in an array. It's a simpler and more readable alternative to traditional for loops when you want to iterate over an array and perform some action on each element.

**Key Points:**

-   Used for `arrays`: `forEach()` is specifically designed for `arrays` and cannot be used directly on `objects`.
-   Does not return a `value`: `Unlike map()`, which creates a new `array`,
-   `forEach()` performs actions on the elements without returning anything.
-   Callback function: The function you provide to `forEach()` gets executed for every element in the `array`.

## Syntax of forEach():

```javascript copy showLineNumbers /element/ /index/ /array/
array.forEach((element, index, array) => {
    // Code to execute on each element
});
```

-   `element`: The current element being processed in the array.
-   `index` (optional): The index of the current element being processed.
-   `array` (optional): The array forEach() was called upon.

Example: Basic `forEach()` Loop

```javascript copy showLineNumbers
const fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"];
fruits.forEach((fruit, index) => {
    console.log(fruit);
});
```

Output:

```json
apple
orange
banana
```

In this example:

-   The `forEach()` loop iterates over the `fruits` array.
-   The function is called for each element, printing the name of the `fruit`.
