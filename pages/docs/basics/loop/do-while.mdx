The `do...while` loop is a variant of the `while` loop. The key difference is that the code inside the `do block` is executed at least once, even if the condition is `false` from the start. The condition is checked after the first iteration.

## Syntax of the `do...while` Loop:

```javascript copy showLineNumbers /condition/
do {
    // code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

Example: Basic `do...while` Loop

```js copy showLineNumbers
let count = 0;
do {
    console.log("hello world");
    count++;
} while (count > 5);
```

In this case:

-   The loop runs once even if the condition is false.
-   After the first run, the condition is checked.

<Callout
    type='warning'
    emoji='ðŸ’¡'>
    In the `do...while` loop, the code block is executed at least once, even
    though the condition is false.
</Callout>
