### JavaScript Switch Statement

**The `switch` statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.**

The JavaScript Switch Statement Use the `switch` statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

Syntax :

```js showLineNumbers
switch (expression) {
    case x: // code block break;
    case y: // code block break;
    default: // code block
}
```

**This is how it works:**

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸš©">
-   The switch expression is evaluated once.

-   The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
-   If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
-   If there is no match, the default code block is executed.

</Callout>

Example: The getDay() method returns the weekday as a number between 0 and 6.

(Sunday=0, Monday=1, Tuesday=2 ..)

This example uses the weekday number to calculate the weekday name:

```js showLineNumbers
switch (new Date().getDay()) {
    case 0:
        day = "Sunday";
        break;
    case 1:
        day = "Monday";
        break;
    case 2:
        day = "Tuesday";
        break;
    case 3:
        day = "Wednesday";
        break;
    case 4:
        day = "Thursday";
        break;
    case 5:
        day = "Friday";
        break;
    case 6:
        day = "Saturday";
        break;
}
```

The default case does not have to be the last case in a switch block:

<Callout
    type='warning'
    emoji='ðŸ’¡'>
    If default is not the last case in the switch block, remember to end the
    default case with a break.
</Callout>

### Switching Details

If multiple cases matches a case value, the first case is selected.

If no matching cases are found, the program continues to the default label.

If no default label is found, the program continues to the statement(s) after the switch.
